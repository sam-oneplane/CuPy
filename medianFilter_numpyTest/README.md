# Median Filter Project

## Overview

This project implement median filter using NumPy lib. 
The median filter is applied to a 2D input array with a specified window size (50, 5000).


1. median_filter_naive.py:
        compute naive median filter using scipy.ndimage
2. median_histogram.py:
        attempt to increse speed by approximation using histogram for median filter sort
3. median_filter.py
        approximation of median filter using interpolation with factor as parameter (default = 2)
